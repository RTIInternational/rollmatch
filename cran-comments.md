## Test environments
* local OS X install (13.6 "Ventura"), R 4.1.2
* win-builder (devel)
* r-hub (window, linux)

## R CMD check results
There were no `ERRORs` when run locally on OS X or on win-builder

## Downstream dependencies
I have run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of rollmatch (dplyr, magrittr, and testthat). All packages passed without `ERRORs` or `WARNINGs`.
