## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.3
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.1.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no `ERRORs`, `WARNINGs` or `NOTEs`

## Downstream dependencies
I have run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of rollmatch (dplyr, magrittr, and testthat). All packages passed without `ERRORs` or `WARNINGs`.
